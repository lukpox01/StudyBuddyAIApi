They offer flexibility in terms of memory allocation and can grow or shrink as needed. \", \"main_content\": \"**Basic Concepts:**\\n- A linked list consists of nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. \\n- The first node is called the head and the last node points to NULL. \\n- Different types of linked lists include singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. \\n**Operations on Linked Lists:**\\n- **Insertion:** Adding a new node at a specific position. \\n- **Deletion:** Removing a node from a specific position. \\n- **Traversal:** Iterating through the linked list to access each node's data. \\n- **Searching:** Finding a specific node based on its data. \\n**Advantages of Linked Lists:**\\n- Dynamic memory allocation: Can grow or shrink as needed. \\n- Efficient insertion and deletion: Easier to modify the structure compared to arrays. \\n**Disadvantages of Linked Lists:**\\n- Random access is not efficient: Requires sequential traversal to access a specific node. \\n- Extra memory overhead: Requires space for pointers in each node. \\n**Example in C++:** \\n "
