They consist of nodes, each containing data and a reference (pointer) to the next node.\", \"main_content\": \"A **singly linked list** has nodes pointing to the next node in sequence. To access an element, you must traverse from the head to the desired location. **Doubly linked lists** have nodes pointing to both the previous and next nodes, enabling bidirectional traversal. **Circular linked lists** have the last node pointing back to the first, forming a cycle. You can implement various operations on linked lists, such as **insertion:** adding a new node at a specific position, **deletion:** removing a node, **traversal:** visiting each node in order, and **searching:** finding a specific element. These operations involve manipulating pointers to achieve the desired effect. **Time complexity** for most operations is O(n), except for accessing the head element, which takes O(1). **Space complexity** depends on the size of the list and the data stored in each node.\", \"summary\": \"Linked lists are efficient for dynamic data storage, offering flexibility in element manipulation.
